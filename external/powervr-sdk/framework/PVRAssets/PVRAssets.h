PVRAssets provides the necessary classes to work with assets and resources, like Model, Mesh, Texture, Effect, Animation, Camera and others. PVRAssets provides built-in support for reading all PowerVR deployment formats (PVR textures, POD models and PFX effects) into these classes, usually with a single line of code. PVRAssets classes are very flexible and can be adapted for a wide variety of uses.
